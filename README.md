### **Video Demo:** https://youtu.be/Pa78HDUMGvg

**EncourageCat Bot** is a Discord bot created to provide encouraging quotes and cat-themed holiday wishes in any server it is added to. The command is $encat. This project was built using Python.

## **What Went Wrong:**

I had trouble running the program, and I kept encountering an error saying "No such file or directory." Upon consulting the Python help text channel in the Codedex Community server, I learned that the program needs to be run in the script files, not the Python install files. The path can be set by clicking the search icon, which is two below the VSCode icon in the top left, or it can also be set by typing `cd C:\Users\kathina\code\discord_encouragecat_bot\`, which will bring the folder. The command is properly written as `python ./encouragecat_bot.py`.

## **Future Improvements:**

Plans include ways to adapt and scale the bot to create other bots with quotes strictly from a particular piece of media. For example, EncourageMon Bot could be a subsequent project that responds with inspiring quotes from the Pokemon series.

## **What I Learned:**

This project was a lesson in both Python and VSCode. It was my first time running a program that functions elsewhere (i.e. Discord). It was cathartic to write a few encouraging messages of my creation. As Code Cat, I enjoyed cat-ifying the holiday messages and assigning corresponding emojis. Raising EncourageCat Bot was a good experience, and I am happy to add it to my beginning collection of coding projects.
